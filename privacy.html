        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>This document has last been updated:</strong> March 19, 2025</p>

        <p>Thank you for using Spark! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data
            when you use our app.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>We designed Spark to respect your privacy. We do not collect or store any personal user data. However, we use
            the following services to improve the app’s functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>TelemetryDeck</strong> – We collect anonymous telemetry data to understand app performance and
                usage patterns. This data contains no personally identifiable information. <a
                    href="https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy" target="_blank">Their privacy policy can be found here</a>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> – We use RevenueCat to help manage subscriptions and in-app purchases.
                RevenueCat does not process payments but facilitates access to purchase information. <a
                    href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">Their privacy policy can be found
                    here</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Apple</strong> – All purchases and subscription handling are securely processed by Apple through
                the App Store. We do not have access to your payment details. <a
                    href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Their privacy policy can be found
                    here</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not share any user data with third parties. The services we use (TelemetryDeck and RevenueCat) may
            process anonymized data as per their privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>Cookies & Tracking</h2>
        <p>Spark does not use cookies or any other tracking technologies.</p>

        <h2>Legal Compliance</h2>
        <p>We aim to comply with global privacy regulations, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong> – Since we do not collect personal data, user
                consent is not required.</li>
            <li><strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</strong> – We do not collect, sell, or share personal
                information.</li>
            <li><strong>Apple App Store Guidelines</strong> – We adhere to Apple’s privacy policies and security
                standards.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we do not store personal data, there is no data to access, modify, or delete. If you have any concerns
            about privacy, you can contact us.</p>
